# Review Command

<command_purpose> Perform exhaustive code reviews using multi-agent analysis, ultra-thinking, and Git worktrees for deep local inspection. </command_purpose>

## Introduction

<role>Senior Code Review Architect with expertise in security, performance, architecture, and quality assurance</role>

## Prerequisites

<requirements>
- Git repository with GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Clean main/master branch
- Proper permissions to create worktrees and access the repository
- For document reviews: Path to a markdown file or document
</requirements>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Determine Review Target & Setup (ALWAYS FIRST)

<review_target> #$ARGUMENTS </review_target>

<thinking>
First, I need to determine the review target type and set up the code for analysis.
</thinking>

#### Immediate Actions:

<task_list>

- [ ] Determine review type: PR number (numeric), GitHub URL, file path (.md), or empty (current branch)
- [ ] Check current git branch
- [ ] If ALREADY on the PR branch → proceed with analysis on current branch
- [ ] If DIFFERENT branch → offer to use worktree: "Use git-worktree skill for isolated Call `skill: git-worktree` with branch name
- [ ] Fetch PR metadata using `gh pr view --json` for title, body, files, linked issues
- [ ] Set up language-specific analysis tools
- [ ] Prepare security scanning environment
- [ ] Make sure we are on the branch we are reviewing. Use gh pr checkout to switch to the branch or manually checkout the branch.

Ensure that the code is ready for analysis (either in worktree or on current branch). ONLY then proceed to the next step.

</task_list>

#### Parallel Agents to review the PR:

<parallel_tasks>

Run ALL or most of these agents at the same time:

1. Task pattern-recognition-specialist(PR content)
2. Task architecture-strategist(PR content)
3. Task security-sentinel(PR content)
4. Task performance-oracle(PR content)
5. Task data-integrity-guardian(PR content)
6. Task agent-native-reviewer(PR content) - Verify new features are agent-accessible
7. Task code-simplicity-reviewer(PR content)
8. If turbo is used: Task rails-turbo-expert(PR content)
9. Task git-history-analyzer(PR content)

</parallel_tasks>

#### Conditional Agents (Run if applicable):

<conditional_agents>

These agents are run ONLY when the PR matches specific criteria. Check the PR files list to determine if they apply:

**If PR contains database migrations (db/migrate/*.rb files) or data backfills:**

14. Task data-migration-expert(PR content) - Validates ID mappings match production, checks for swapped values, verifies rollback safety
15. Task deployment-verification-agent(PR content) - Creates Go/No-Go deployment checklist with SQL verification queries

**When to run migration agents:**
- PR includes files matching `db/migrate/*.rb`
- PR modifies columns that store IDs, enums, or mappings
- PR includes data backfill scripts or rake tasks
- PR changes how data is read/written (e.g., changing from FK to string column)
- PR title/body mentions: migration, backfill, data transformation, ID mapping

**What these agents check:**
- `data-migration-expert`: Verifies hard-coded mappings match production reality (prevents swapped IDs), checks for orphaned associations, validates dual-write patterns
- `deployment-verification-agent`: Produces executable pre/post-deploy checklists with SQL queries, rollback procedures, and monitoring plans

</conditional_agents>

### 4. Ultra-Thinking Deep Dive Phases

<ultrathink_instruction> For each phase below, spend maximum cognitive effort. Think step by step. Consider all angles. Question assumptions. And bring all reviews in a synthesis to the user.</ultrathink_instruction>

<deliverable>
Complete system context map with component interactions
</deliverable>

#### Phase 3: Stakeholder Perspective Analysis

<thinking_prompt> ULTRA-THINK: Put yourself in each stakeholder's shoes. What matters to them? What are their pain points? </thinking_prompt>

<stakeholder_perspectives>

1. **Developer Perspective** <questions>

   - How easy is this to understand and modify?
   - Are the APIs intuitive?
   - Is debugging straightforward?
   - Can I test this easily? </questions>

2. **Operations Perspective** <questions>

   - How do I deploy this safely?
   - What metrics and logs are available?
   - How do I troubleshoot issues?
   - What are the resource requirements? </questions>

3. **End User Perspective** <questions>

   - Is the feature intuitive?
   - Are error messages helpful?
   - Is performance acceptable?
   - Does it solve my problem? </questions>

4. **Security Team Perspective** <questions>

   - What's the attack surface?
   - Are there compliance requirements?
   - How is data protected?
   - What are the audit capabilities? </questions>

5. **Business Perspective** <questions>
   - What's the ROI?
   - Are there legal/compliance risks?
   - How does this affect time-to-market?
   - What's the total cost of ownership? </questions> </stakeholder_perspectives>

#### Phase 4: Scenario Exploration

<thinking_prompt> ULTRA-THINK: Explore edge cases and failure scenarios. What could go wrong? How does the system behave under stress? </thinking_prompt>

<scenario_checklist>

- [ ] **Happy Path**: Normal operation with valid inputs
- [ ] **Invalid Inputs**: Null, empty, malformed data
- [ ] **Boundary Conditions**: Min/max values, empty collections
- [ ] **Concurrent Access**: Race conditions, deadlocks
- [ ] **Scale Testing**: 10x, 100x, 1000x normal load
- [ ] **Network Issues**: Timeouts, partial failures
- [ ] **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory, disk, connections
- [ ] **Security Attacks**: Injection, overflow, DoS
- [ ] **Data Corruption**: Partial writes, inconsistency
- [ ] **Cascading Failures**: Downstream service issues </scenario_checklist>

### 4. Simplification and Minimalism Review

Run the Task code-simplicity-reviewer() to see if we can simplify the code.

### 5. Findings Synthesis and Action

<critical_requirement> Use Claude Code's built-in TodoWrite tool to track findings during the session. Present findings to user with inline approval before taking action. </critical_requirement>

#### Step 1: Synthesize All Findings

<thinking>
Consolidate all agent reports into a categorized list of findings.
Remove duplicates, prioritize by severity and impact.
</thinking>

<synthesis_tasks>

- [ ] Collect findings from all parallel agents
- [ ] Categorize by type: security, performance, architecture, quality, etc.
- [ ] Assign severity levels: 🔴 CRITICAL (P1), 🟡 IMPORTANT (P2), 🔵 NICE-TO-HAVE (P3)
- [ ] Remove duplicate or overlapping findings
- [ ] Estimate effort for each finding (Small/Medium/Large)
- [ ] Add all findings to TodoWrite for session tracking

</synthesis_tasks>

#### Step 2: Present Findings and Get Approval

Use **AskUserQuestion** to present findings and get user decision:

```markdown
**Question:** "Found X issues (Y critical, Z important). What would you like to do?"

**Options:**
1. Resolve all - Start fixing all findings immediately
2. Resolve critical only - Fix P1 items only
3. Add to TodoWrite - Track all findings for later in this session
4. Skip - Don't resolve any
```

**Severity Definitions:**

- **🔴 P1 (Critical - Blocks Merge):** Security vulnerabilities, data corruption risks, breaking changes
- **🟡 P2 (Important - Should Fix):** Performance issues, architectural concerns, reliability issues
- **🔵 P3 (Nice-to-Have):** Minor improvements, code cleanup, documentation updates

#### Step 3: Execute Based on User Choice

**If "Resolve all" or "Resolve critical only":**

1. Update TodoWrite with selected findings as tasks
2. Mark first task as in_progress
3. Implement fix following existing patterns
4. Run tests after each fix
5. Mark task completed, move to next
6. Continue until all selected findings resolved

**If "Add to TodoWrite":**

Add all findings to TodoWrite as pending tasks:
```
TodoWrite: [
  {"content": "🔴 P1: [Finding 1]", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Fixing [Finding 1]"},
  {"content": "🟡 P2: [Finding 2]", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Fixing [Finding 2]"},
  ...
]
```

**If "Skip":**

Present summary of findings but take no action. User can address later.

#### Step 4: Summary Report

Present comprehensive summary:

```markdown
## ✅ Code Review Complete

**Review Target:** PR #XXXX - [PR Title]
**Branch:** [branch-name]

### Findings Summary:

- **Total Findings:** [X]
- **🔴 CRITICAL (P1):** [count] - BLOCKS MERGE
- **🟡 IMPORTANT (P2):** [count] - Should Fix
- **🔵 NICE-TO-HAVE (P3):** [count] - Enhancements

### Action Taken:

[Based on user choice: resolved, created issues, or documented]

### Review Agents Used:

- pattern-recognition-specialist
- architecture-strategist
- security-sentinel
- performance-oracle
- data-integrity-guardian
- agent-native-reviewer
- code-simplicity-reviewer

### Next Steps:

[If issues created: Link to GitHub issues]
[If resolved: Summary of fixes made]
[If skipped: Reminder to address before merge]
```

### 7. End-to-End Testing (Optional)

<detect_project_type>

**First, detect the project type from PR files:**

| Indicator | Project Type |
|-----------|--------------|
| `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, `Package.swift` (iOS) | iOS/macOS |
| `Gemfile`, `package.json`, `app/views/*`, `*.html.*` | Web |
| Both iOS files AND web files | Hybrid (test both) |

</detect_project_type>

<offer_testing>

After presenting the Summary Report, offer appropriate testing based on project type:

**For Web Projects:**
```markdown
**"Want to run browser tests on the affected pages?"**
1. Yes - run `/test-browser`
2. No - skip
```

**For iOS Projects:**
```markdown
**"Want to run Xcode simulator tests on the app?"**
1. Yes - run `/xcode-test`
2. No - skip
```

**For Hybrid Projects (e.g., Rails + Hotwire Native):**
```markdown
**"Want to run end-to-end tests?"**
1. Web only - run `/test-browser`
2. iOS only - run `/xcode-test`
3. Both - run both commands
4. No - skip
```

</offer_testing>

#### If User Accepts Web Testing:

Spawn a subagent to run browser tests (preserves main context):

```
Task general-purpose("Run /test-browser for PR #[number]. Test all affected pages, check for console errors, handle failures by creating todos and fixing.")
```

The subagent will:
1. Identify pages affected by the PR
2. Navigate to each page and capture snapshots (using Playwright MCP or agent-browser CLI)
3. Check for console errors
4. Test critical interactions
5. Pause for human verification on OAuth/email/payment flows
6. Create P1 todos for any failures
7. Fix and retry until all tests pass

**Standalone:** `/test-browser [PR number]`

#### If User Accepts iOS Testing:

Spawn a subagent to run Xcode tests (preserves main context):

```
Task general-purpose("Run /xcode-test for scheme [name]. Build for simulator, install, launch, take screenshots, check for crashes.")
```

The subagent will:
1. Verify XcodeBuildMCP is installed
2. Discover project and schemes
3. Build for iOS Simulator
4. Install and launch app
5. Take screenshots of key screens
6. Capture console logs for errors
7. Pause for human verification (Sign in with Apple, push, IAP)
8. Create P1 todos for any failures
9. Fix and retry until all tests pass

**Standalone:** `/xcode-test [scheme]`

### Important: P1 Findings Block Merge

Any **🔴 P1 (CRITICAL)** findings must be addressed before merging the PR. Present these prominently and ensure they're resolved before accepting the PR.
